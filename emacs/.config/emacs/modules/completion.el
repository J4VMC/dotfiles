;;; completion.el --- Additional tools for completion utilities -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file configures the entire "completion" experience in Emacs.
;; "Completion" is Emacs's term for autocompletion, fuzzy finding, and
;; narrowing down lists of options.
;;
;; ;; 
;;
;; The configuration is broken into two distinct ecosystems:
;;
;; 1. MINIBUFFER COMPLETION (The "Vertico Stack"):
;;    Handles anything you do in the command bar at the bottom of the screen.
;;    - `M-x` (find command)
;;    - `C-x C-f` (find file)
;;    - `C-x b` (switch buffer)
;;    Core packages: Vertico, Consult, Orderless, Marginalia, Embark.
;;
;; 2. IN-BUFFER COMPLETION (The "Corfu Stack"):
;;    Handles the "autocomplete" pop-up that appears *in your code*
;;    as you are typing.
;;    Core packages: Corfu, Cape, Tempel.
;;
;; These two stacks are modern, minimal, and work together perfectly
;; to create a fast and highly capable completion system.
;;
;;; Code:

;; =============================================================================
;; CORE EMACS COMPLETION BEHAVIOR
;; =============================================================================

;; Tweak built-in Emacs settings before loading third-party packages.
(use-package emacs
  :ensure nil
  :init
  ;; Allow running minibuffer commands *while* you are already in a minibuffer.
  ;; -> Essential for complex workflows (e.g., searching for a file while inside `M-x`).
  (setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
  :custom
  ;; Start cycling through completion candidates with TAB after 3 options.
  (completion-cycle-threshold 3)
  ;; Make TAB "smart": first try to indent the current line. If the line is
  ;; already indented, then try to trigger autocomplete.
  (tab-always-indent 'complete)
  ;; For Emacs 30+: Disable a built-in completion feature that conflicts
  ;; with our custom Corfu/Cape setup below.
  (text-mode-ispell-word-completion nil)
  ;; Make M-x (`execute-extended-command`) show *all* available commands,
  ;; rather than Emacs trying to hide commands it thinks are irrelevant.
  (read-extended-command-predicate #'command-completion-default-include-p))

;; =============================================================================
;; MINIBUFFER COMPLETION (THE VERTICO STACK)
;; =============================================================================

;; Vertico: The core User Interface for the minibuffer.
;; -> Replaces the default, clunky grid with a clean, fast, vertical list.
(use-package vertico
  :ensure t
  :init
  (vertico-mode) ; Enable the vertical UI globally.
  :custom
  ;; Allow navigation to wrap around. Pressing 'down' at the bottom of the
  ;; list takes you back to the top, and vice-versa.
  (vertico-cycle t))

;; Vertico Directory: Improves file path navigation inside the minibuffer.
(use-package vertico-directory
  :ensure nil ; Built-in with Vertico, so no need to download.
  :after vertico
  :bind (:map vertico-map
              ;; In `C-x C-f` (find-file), `M-DEL` (Alt-Backspace) deletes
              ;; exactly one directory level (e.g., "foo/bar/" becomes "foo/").
              ("M-DEL" . vertico-directory-delete-word)))

;; Orderless: The "brains" behind the search filtering.
;; -> Lets you type search terms in *any order*, separated by spaces.
;; -> Example: Typing "init comp" will easily find `completion.el` inside `init/`.
(use-package orderless
  :ensure t
  :init
  ;; Set `orderless` as the *only* completion style, overriding old defaults.
  (setq completion-styles '(orderless))
  (setq completion-category-defaults nil))

;; Marginalia: Adds rich annotations (metadata) to the side of Vertico lists.
;; -> `find-file` shows file permissions and sizes.
;; -> `describe-function` shows the function's documentation string.
(use-package marginalia
  :ensure t
  :after vertico
  :init (marginalia-mode))

;; Consult: Provides supercharged versions of built-in Emacs search commands.
;; -> All of these seamlessly use the Vertico/Orderless UI setup above.

;; Embark: The "Actions" framework.
;; -> Acts like a powerful right-click menu for the minibuffer.
